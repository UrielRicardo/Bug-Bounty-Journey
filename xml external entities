XML External Entities(XXE)
	WHAT IS?
	
	Applications those parse XML Inputs
	XML Input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser
	XXE may lead to disclosure of *sensitive data, SSRF, Port Scanning, DOS or RCE*

Why XXE Happens?

/Incorrect processing on SML input and parsing/


What can be achieved by XXE?
	- XXE may lead to disclosure of
		Sensitive data (/etc/passwd)
		SSRF (Hit a request to your collaborator /server)
		Port Scanning (enumerate ips and ports)
		DOS (Denial of Service)
		RCE (Remote code Execution OOB)
		

How do we fix XXE issues?

	Validate or escape tainted data within the system identifier in the DTD.
	The safest way to prevemt XXE is always to disable DTDs(External Entities) Completely.
	Depending on the parser, disable DTD's
