Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
	What is?
		Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring and active response leads to this attack
		Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins and high-value transactions are not logged
		Logs are stored locally
		The application is unable to detect, scalate or alert for active attacks in real time or near real time
		
Why ILAM Happens?
	You are vulnerable to information leakage if you make logging and alerting events visible to a user or an attacker
	Log everything - Access control failures, and server-side input validation failures, damn everything!
	
What can be achieved by ILAM?
	You are vulnerable to information leakage if you make logging and alerting events visible to a user or an attacker
	
	Ex: A major US retailer reportedly had an internal malware analysis sandbox analyzing attachments. The sandbox software had detected potentially unwanted software, but no one responded to this detection. the sandbox had been producing warnings for some time before the breach was detected due to fraudulent card transactions by an external bank.
	
How do we fix ILAM issues?
	Ensure effective Logging and Monitoring
	Usage of good monitoring and alerting protection
	Log, Log and Log!
