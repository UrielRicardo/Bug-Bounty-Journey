Broken Access Control(BAC)

	WHAT IS?

	Restricted users access not properly handled.
		example:
			There is a login portal for school having 3 access levels.
			1Student, 2.Teacher, 3.Principal
			
			Student should access and manage his own attendance,
			Teacher should be allowed to see/modify students data
			Principal should have access to teacher and students data
		If access controll is not configured, students is able to modify others and teacher data also.
		
		
Why BAC Happens?
	*Due to lack of effective Access Control between 2 roles*
	*Best Example in Bankin Sector is Maker and Checker roles*
		if maker is able to bypass checker's funcionality, then its a Flaw
		
		

What can be achieved by BAC?
	Horizontal Escalation - user to user
	Vertical Escalation - user to admin / admin to super admin
	Cross Origin Resource Sharing
	Access to API with missing access control for POST, PUT AND DELETE
	Allowing Primary key to view/edit/modify/change someones data
	Metadata manipulation such as replaying JWT access control tokens
	
How do we fix BAC issues?
	Implement Strong Access Control Mechanism
	Only Effective if enforced in trust server side code or server less API
	Tokens, Auth should be invalidated as soon as logout
	Decisions should not be made by plain coockies param like user=admin, access=super admin, roles=tiktoker
