Sensitive Data Exposure(SDE)
	WHAT IS?
	
- Attacker views sd and get access to internal network
- Application or API do not protect sd properly like user account details, credit card details, password etc.
- Github Tokens and API Keys leakages (Hackerone Snapchat Reports)
- Sensitiveinvoices indexed by Google (Paypal Invoice Reports)
- Insecure storage of Data also Leads to SDE.
	db.conf, login, passwords.txt e etc
	
Why SDE Happens?

	*No proper access control over when exchanging sensitive data*
	*API's not properly protected*
	*Lack of robots.txt*
	*Lack of Data strip when saving at server*
	
	
What can be achieved by SDE?
	Sensitive information odf the users leak, ie- Transaction Details, Passwords
	API keys
	Tokens of internal portal only accessible to domain Admins
	Passwords, SSH Keys, aka anything that is sensitive.
	
	
How do we fix SDE issues?
	*Dont store sensitive data unnecessarily*
	*Make sure to encrypt all SD at rest*
	*Disable caching Responses that has SD*
	*Do not put keys, tokens in github or anywhere in server*
	*Implement Access Control for users(Maker Checker Funcionality)*
